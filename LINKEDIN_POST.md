# LinkedIn Post Template for AI Knowledge Vault

## Main Post

üß† **Built an AI Knowledge Vault** ‚Äî chat with your documents using embeddings + vector search! 

Just finished building this intelligent document processing system that lets you:

‚úÖ Upload PDFs, web articles, transcripts ‚Üí automatically chunks & embeds them
‚úÖ Ask questions like "Explain Unilever MRP demand logic" ‚Üí gets answers from your stored docs  
‚úÖ Multi-file chat with memory of last 5 interactions
‚úÖ Beautiful Streamlit UI with PDF preview & answer export

**Tech Stack:**
‚Ä¢ LangChain + ChromaDB for vector storage
‚Ä¢ Azure OpenAI (Embeddings + GPT-4)
‚Ä¢ Streamlit for the frontend
‚Ä¢ PyPDF2, BeautifulSoup for document processing

**Key Features:**
üîç Semantic search across multiple document types
üí¨ Conversational AI with context awareness  
üìä Document management & statistics
üì• Export chat history as CSV
üé® Modern, responsive UI

This is perfect for research assistants, document Q&A, knowledge management, and content analysis. The system maintains context across conversations and provides source references for every answer.

**What would you use this for?** Research papers, company docs, educational materials, or something else?

## Technical Deep Dive Version

üß† **Building an AI Knowledge Vault: From Concept to Production**

Just completed a comprehensive document processing and chat system that demonstrates the power of modern AI tooling:

**Architecture:**
‚Ä¢ Document ingestion pipeline (PDF, web, text) with intelligent chunking
‚Ä¢ Vector embeddings using Azure OpenAI for semantic search
‚Ä¢ ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval
‚Ä¢ Conversational AI with memory management
‚Ä¢ Streamlit frontend with real-time chat interface

**Key Technical Decisions:**
‚Ä¢ LangChain for orchestration and document processing
‚Ä¢ Recursive text splitting with overlap for better context
‚Ä¢ ConversationBufferWindowMemory for maintaining context
‚Ä¢ ChromaDB for persistent vector storage
‚Ä¢ Azure OpenAI for both embeddings and chat completion

**Challenges Solved:**
‚Ä¢ Handling multiple document formats consistently
‚Ä¢ Managing memory across conversations
‚Ä¢ Providing source attribution for AI responses
‚Ä¢ Creating an intuitive user experience for non-technical users

**Results:**
Users can now upload any document and have intelligent conversations about the content, with full source tracking and export capabilities.

This project showcases how to build production-ready AI applications that are both powerful and user-friendly.

## Demo-Focused Version

üß† **Live Demo: AI Knowledge Vault**

Just built this and it's working beautifully! Here's what it can do:

1. **Upload a PDF** ‚Üí System automatically chunks and embeds it
2. **Ask "What are the main findings?"** ‚Üí AI searches and summarizes from your document
3. **Follow up with "Explain the methodology"** ‚Üí AI remembers context and provides detailed answers
4. **View source references** ‚Üí See exactly which parts of your document informed each answer

**Try it yourself:**
‚Ä¢ Upload research papers, company docs, or any text
‚Ä¢ Ask questions in natural language
‚Ä¢ Get intelligent answers with full source attribution
‚Ä¢ Export your entire conversation history

Built with LangChain + ChromaDB + Azure OpenAI + Streamlit.

**What documents would you upload first?** üìö
